# GifTastic
Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. To finish this task, I have to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

Instruction:
  To get started click on the available animal name buttons or type in a topic in the textbox provided  on the right top side of the screen and click on the enter button. A list of 10 static images will show up with the rating of each image along with it. When you click on any of the 10 images the images will animate, when you click again the animation stop.
